# Front-end todos

## Do next:

_1. Create a login page, and a basic feed page_

1. Login logic:

   - Need to check if the user has previously signed-in in the past 24 hours.
     - To do this, I need to store the user token somewhere (in the store?)
   - If so, show feed page
   - Else ask user to login by directing them to the login page

2. Login UI:
